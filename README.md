# Comparative-Cooling-Analysis-Wind-2-m-s-vs.-Water-Flow-1-m-s-
This CFD analysis investigates and compares the thermal performance of a panel cooled by **air flow at 2 m/s** (previous study) and **water flow at 1 m/s** (this current study). The focus is on evaluating the improvement in cooling when the same heat load is applied to the system but different cooling mediums are used.
